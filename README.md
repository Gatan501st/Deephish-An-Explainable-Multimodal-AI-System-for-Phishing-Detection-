# Email Parser Project

This project is part of a multi-sprint development plan to build an AI-powered phishing email detection and analysis tool.  
The system parses emails, extracts features, and integrates with machine learning models to detect malicious content.

## Features

- Parse `.eml` or raw email files
- Extract headers, body, links, and attachments
- Integration with machine learning (future sprints)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
